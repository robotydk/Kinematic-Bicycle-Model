# Kinematic-Bicycle-Model

This Model was implemented as under the Introduction to Self-Driving Cars course by Coursera.
It is a 2D kinematic model reprensenting a 4-wheeler vehicle model: the front 2 wheels are replaced by a single wheel placed equidistant from the two front wheels and similarly the rear 2 wheels are replaced by a single wheel placed equidistant from the rear 2 wheels.
The inputs to the Model are velocity of the vehicle and steering rate. The model is made to move in a figure 8 trajectory.
